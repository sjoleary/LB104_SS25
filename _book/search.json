    "section": "",
    "text": "Course Logistics\nWelcome to our lab handbook for General Biology II (Spring 2025) - it will be continuously updated throughout the semester. For the most part an electronic copy of this lab manual will be sufficient1, if you need to print anything for a class you will be prompted to do so on Canvas as part of your pre-lab assignments.1 You can go “split screen” on your laptop which will allow you to cut and paste code if needed or if you have a tablet you can pull up the manual there which gives you a better simultaneous viewing experience.\nThe lab portion of this course will consist of one one-off lab, followed up by three research projects:\n\nUnit 1: Climate & Biomes\nUnit 2: Community Ecology: Marvelous World of Milk Microbes\nUnit 3: Road Ecology: Salt, Seeds, and Germination Success (?)\nUnit 4: Urban Ecology: Linking Lichen and Urban Landscapes\n\nFor each lab unit we will compile a research compendium that will hold your data and results. We will start off with more scaffolded activities and assignments and as you become more confident in your skills you will be increasingly independent in designing your experiments.\nOver the course of the semester you will become increasingly independent in your ability engage in all aspects of the scientific process, starting with making observations on the foundation of which you will formulate a hypothesis, design an experiment to test this hypothesis and make predictions about the outcome, collect, visualize, and analyze data, and report your findings in a written format.\nAfter completing the lab component of this course, you will have a fundamental skill set that will allow you to\n\nmake observations and use these to formulate a question and generate a hypothesis.\ndesign an appropriate experiment to generate and collect data to answer your question.\ncollect, visualize, and analyze data using appropriate qualitative and quantitative methods.\ncommunicate your research findings following the convention of a written scientific report including (1) an introduction that describes the context for the general research question and specific hypothesis being tested, (2) a description of the methods used to collect and analyze data, (3) description of the results including summary figures and tables, and (4) a discussion which identifies and explains central results in the context of the specific hypothesis and general research question posed.\n\nYou will be working in small groups during lab to work through activties, design your experiment and gather and analyze data. At the end of each research project you will submit an individual written report. Generally, you will be assigned some pre-lab work such as background reading before your lab period so we can maximize our time in lab. Each project is unique in the questions we are exploring and the methods we will use to answer them. You will at times be expected to complete tasks/assignments outside of our scheduled lab periods. Some projects will required more time outside of labs than others and you may be involved in more than one module at a time.\nAll lab prep work and graded assignments should be completed by the assigned deadlines. No late work is accepted. Make sure you are planning ahead so you have enough time to ask for help if you need it.\nFor the lab component of this course to run smoothly, you will need to take an active role in preparing for and participating in lab. It is your responsibility to be aware of communications made in the syllabus, through announcements on Canvas, or emails. While it is always our goal to make those in a timely fashion, some last minute calls may be unavoidable. Similarly, you are expected to arrive for your lab period on time and prepared for the planned activities, including completing all assigned tasks and/or reading assignments, bringing your laptop and charger, along with any lab-related handouts2. We will be working with a lot of digital documents this semester, avoid last minute computer-related disasters by saving your work frequently and regularly backing up your files on an external drive or the cloud that you can access from another computer. If you run into issues where you will not have access to a laptop, contact your instructor and Dr. O’Leary as quickly as possible so we can make sure you can participate e.g. by finding you an alternate laptop to complete assignment in/out of lab.2 For documents that are digital including write-ups of your study design, spreadsheets with data etc. make sure that you can easily access those during lab periods. For any hard copies make sure that you print those and bring them with you as instructed.\nAll members of a group are expected to contribute to the design of each project along with collecting and analyzing data. It’s important that you establish a good working relationship with your group and hold each other accountable for the contributions that you make to this project; this may involve scheduling meetings outside of lab time. Strive to be a good team player by making sure you are responsive to your group and have open lines of communication to arrange meetings and complete assignments. We will frequently combine data sets within groups and lab sections or across sections for analysis to get large sample sizes and/or replicates, therefore it is critical that you complete out-of-lab assignments by the posted deadlines in order for your group to be able to progress through the research projects. Procrastination is frequently at the root of assignments not being completed well. When you are collaborating with others be mindful that your time management will impact the time management of others. Account for this both when you plan as a group how to divide up work and in how you complete tasks assigned to you by making sure to get started early enough to not hold up your group. While it is primarily your responsibility to coordinate and work with your group, if you are having difficulties with group members not contributing as agreed upon or other problems working together, please reach out to Dr. O’Leary or your lab instructor and we will step in to help facilitate a solution.\nAttendance in lab is mandatory. You are allowed one absence per semester. You should always inform both your instructor and Dr. O’Leary in writing (an email) of your absence before lab. If you will be missing lab due to a direct conflict with a planned college-sponsored event you must contact your instructor and Dr. O’Leary at least one week in advance as that will give us more flexibility in planning how you can complete the lab and/or assign alternative activities. Regardless of the reason you are missing lab, you are responsible for material covered in lab and completing any pre-lab and/or homework assignments associated with a missed lab period; we will communicate with you in which form you will need to make-up in-lab assignments and activities. Additionally, you should always contact your group members for whatever project(s) you are currently working on as soon as possible to learn what you will be responsible for on any group assignments.\nThis semester will include some field-based activities. Your safety is always a priority and while it is always our goal to design activities that are accessible to everyone and minimize risk there are more factors that we cannot control outside of the lab. Help us out by using common sense, keeping an eye on your lab mates, and advocating for yourself. For field-based activities please make sure that you check the weather conditions ahead of time and then ensure you are appropriately dressed in terms of layers to stay warm or cool, with shoes that can get muddy or wet. If it is sunny/hot out make sure to wear sun screen and/or a head covering, bring water etc. if you have any allergies or other medical conditions that might require emergency treatment, please let your instructor know and carry any medication you might need on you (inhaler, EpiPen, etc). Occasionally there may be unavoidable weather-related last minute changes, please make sure to check your email/Canvas for last minute notifications. If you are doing any field work on your own outside of lab time, please be mindful of your safety, at the very least let somebody know where you are going and when you expect to be back, ideally bring a buddy with you.\nAcademic dishonesty, including but not limited to cheating, plagiarism, or turning in someone else’s work as your own will not be tolerated. Make sure you are properly citing the sources of ideas, figures, data, etc. in your lab reports. Plagiarism not only includes direct, word-for-word quotations without identifying it as a direct quote using quotation marks and citing the source but also paraphrasing other people’s ideas, arguments, or structure without properly acknowledging them. Learning how to properly summarize and paraphrase information from an original source is an important skill, as we generally do not use word-for-word citations in the scientific reports in the natural sciences. While it is acceptable to use large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence applications to assist you in correcting grammar, syntax or spelling or to generate synonyms, you should not use LLMs generate larger sections of text for you3. If you are unsure if you are properly attributing components of your written assignments, please come talk to your lab instructor or Dr. O’Leary4, we are happy to help. Evidence of academic dishonesty will at minimum result in a zero on that assignment along with an automatic notification of the Dean.3 Given the definitions of plagiarism above consider how this can fall into both the narrow category of not attributing a direct citation. Additionally, you don’t know the extent to which the LLM is “borrowing” other peoples ideas, arguments, or structure of presenting them. As a results, you would not be properly attributing content and ideas to those sources.4 As a rule of thumb: If you are using LLMs or AI in a way that you are not comfortable us as instructors knowing about, that is a strong indication that you are doing something you should not be."

    "text": "1.3 A climate zone is a section of earth’s surface defined by its mean annual temperature and total annual precipitation along with monthly/seasonal variations and extremes\nWeather is a snapshot of atmospheric conditions at a specific time point and location and can be broken down into readily measurable, discrete characteristics including temperature, precipitation, wind speed/direction, cloud coverage, and air pressure. By contrast, climate a statistical “portrait” on a long-term time scale1. To describe the climate of a specific location, scientists determine long-term averages and identify the extremes for a specific place, region, or an entire planet based on a single or multiple measuring stations.1 Typically, averages are calculated over at least 30 years to describe climate.\nIn 1884, the German-Russian botanist and climatologist2 Wladimir Köppen published a climate classification scheme that is still widely used today with some modifications from the original definitions. These climate zones are defined by their mean annual temperature and total annual precipitation along with monthly/seasonal variations and extremes and roughly form latitudinal bands. For larger continents the oceans and mountain ranges will impact patterns temperature and precipitation and result in regional differences.2 Even though we have distinct definitions for climate zones vs biomes you will notice in today’s lab that these concepts are tightly linked, with climate being the primary determinant of biomes - though Köppen identifed climate zones based on his experience as a botanist and used characteristic types of vegetation to help identify climate zones.\n\nGroup A: tropical climates are characterized by high levels of precipitation and every month having an average temperature of &gt;18°C.\nGroup B: arid climates are primarily defined by very low levels of precipitation and include hot deserts (subtropics, average annual temperature &gt;18°C) and cold deserts (coldest month average temperature &gt;0°C).\nGroup C: temperate climates are primarily defined by moderate temperatures with the coldest month having average temperatures between 0°C - 18°C and at least one month with an average temperature &gt;10°C and can include both regions with one dry/wet season or no significant difference between seasons in terms of precipitation. Overall, they have a wider variation of temperature and precipitation compared to tropical and arid climates.\nGroup D: continental climates are colder compared to temperate climates and have a wider range of temperatures with at least one month with average temperatures &lt;0°C and at least one month &gt;10°C though precipitation patterns are similar to temperature climates, where depending on the regions there may be a pattern of wet/dry season or no dry season.\nGroup E: Includes polar and alpine climates3 that feature the coldest temperatures with an average temperature &lt;10°C and low levels of precipitation.\n\n3 If you increasing in altitude and latitude you will a similar experience of decreasing temperature though for different regions.A climatogram or climograph is a graphical summary of monthly long-term averages of temperature and precipitation and are a useful tool to describe the climate of a given location.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Climatograph for Manchester, NH. This graph is labeled both for the metric system (degrees Celsius and millimeters) and the English system (degrees Fahrenheit and inches), as budding scientists, we will be using the metric system for lab but you’ll be able to refer back to this figure as a point of orientation to units you are more familiar with.\n\n\nClimatograms have double x-axis that allows them to depict to data sets in one graph. For example, Figure 1.2 summarizes the average monthly patterns for temperature on the left x-axis using a line graph (red line) and the precipitation as a bar chart on the right x-axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGive it a try\n\n\n\nUse the climograph for Manchester to answer the following questions about Manchester’s climate.\n\nMaximum average monthly temperature: ……. (hottest month: …….)\nMinimum average monthly temperature: ……. (coldest month: …….)\nAverage annual temperature: …….\nMaximum monthly precipitation: ……. (wettest month: …….)\nMinimum monthly precipitation: …….

    "text": "1.4 Global climate patterns are largely determined by input of solar energy\nThe curved shape of Earth’s surface results in latitudinal variation in the amount of solar energy received at earth’s surface, warming the atmosphere, land, and oceans.\n\nThe Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn are the northern and southern circles of latitude4 at which the sun can be directly overhead5.\nThe Arctic and Antarctic Circle6 are the northern and southern most latitudes at which during the June and December solstice the sun dues not rise/does not set all. Currently, these are located at approx. 66.33°N/S.\n\n4 Due to the wobble in earth’s axis the exact location changes over time, currently it is at about 23.4°5 This occurs at the June (Northern) and December (Southern) solstice at which point the planet reaches its maximum tilt towards the sun.6 Collectively, these are referred to as the polar circlesAdditionally, the tilt of earth’s axis relative to its axis means that throughout a year the different locations on earth’s surface differ in whether they are tilted towards or away from the planet and thus the incoming angle of solar energy, resulting in seasonal variation of the climate. At the equator, this effect is negligible but the increases towards the poles.\nThe differences in the amount of energy received at earth’s surface result in a temperature gradient with highest temperatures at the equator that decrease moving north and south towards the pols. In turn, these temperature differences drive global patterns of atmospheric circulation and precipitation.\n\nHigh levels of evaporation at the equator result in warm, wet air masses rising and flowing towards the pols, creating a low pressure zone (Intertropical convergence zone, ITCZ). As the air rises, it cools, releasing most of the water vapor and resulting in high levels of precipitation in the tropics.\nAround 30°N/S, the dry air has cooled and now sinks towards earth’s surface, creating a high pressure zone with some of the air flowing back to the equator and some of it towards the poles along the surface. In both cases, the dry air absorbs most of the moisture thus creating the arid climates found in the subtropics, forming a band of deserts north and south of the tropics.\nAt the poles, cold air descends, creating a high pressure zone, with air flowing towards the mid-latitudes at the earth’s surface. Around 60°N/S, this air meets air flowing away from the equator. This creates another low pressure zone with air masses rising, cooling and releasing precipitation and resulting in dry air flowing towards the poles/equator.\n\nIn short, there are three cells of overturning air circulation that create alternating patterns of low pressure zones associated with high levels of precipitation and high pressure associated with low levels of precipitation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGive it a try\n\n\n\nComplete the sketch summarizing major patterns of air circulation and precipitation to include lines representing incoming solar energy. Indicate differences in the angle at which the energy is received and highlight areas that receive the most/least amount of energy creating a latitudinal gradient in temperature."

For example, even if there might be distinct combinations of plants and animals found in tropical forests in Africa, compared to those in South America or Southeast Asia, they are still are characterized by tall dominant trees and an overall very high diversity of plants animals.\nYou would also notice that all of these tropical forests share a similar climate characterized by high temperatures with little variation throughout the year, a very high total annual amount of precipitation with a high variation - typically tropical forests have only two seasons, one of which is extremely rainy.

    "section": "3.1 Introduction",
    "text": "3.1 Introduction\n\n3.1.1 Ecological Succession\nSuccession is a well-documented ecological phenomenon that we will discuss during out Community Ecology modeule in lecture. As a reminder, ecological succession is defined as a transition in species composition within a community following a disturbance or during the establishment of a community in an uninhabited environment. This sequential change in species composition in successional communities is in response to ongoing physical changes in the environment. These physical environmental changes are often brought about by the very species that composed earlier successional stages. As one community grows, it modifies the environment, and a different community develops as a result.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider this\n\n\n\nDuring our biome exploration we talked about how the climate (abiotic factors) play a key role in determining which plants can grow in specific locations. Discuss the idea that the ecological community “modifies the environment”:\n\nhow do biological organisms change the abiotic component of ecosystems? examples?\nhow does this change how we should think about ecosystems as static versus dynamic?\nhow does this change how we should think about population dynamics over time?\nhow might this relate to life history strategies and in which types of ecosystems they are successful?\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Milk Nutrients and Spoilage\nMilk is a highly nutritious food containing important macromolecules: carbohydrates (lactose, a milk sugar), proteins (casein, commonly referred to as curd), and lipids (butterfat). This high level of nutrition makes milk an excellent medium for the growth of bacteria and other microbes. To minimize the risk of spoilage, milk is pasteurized. Pasteurization is a process by which milk is heated to a specific temperature for a set period of time to kill harmful bacteria. Pasteurizing milk does not sterilize it (sterilizing kills all bacteria) but merely destroys the pathogenic bacteria, leaving many bacteria that will multiply very slowly at refrigerator temperatures. However, if left at room temperature, the surviving bacteria will quickly grow and bring about milk spoilage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider this\n\n\n\nIn this example what is the biological community we are observing? What is the disturbance/catastrophic event that triggers ecological succession?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe microbes would be the ecological community, pasteurization would be the disturbance event that dramatically alters the community by removing some population altogether and decimating others. It creates a “system restart”.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Milk Microbes\nOur next few weeks of lab will examine microbial succession in milk, so let’s first define what we mean by”microbe” or microorganism.\nSimply stated, microbes are organisms that are too small to be seen without using a microscope. For the purposes of this lab, microbes include three broad groups of biological taxa:\n\nbacteria (type of prokaryote)\nyeasts (unicellular fungi),\nmolds (multicellular fungi).\n\nThese three types of microbes can be distinguished by their\n\nsize\ncell type (prokaryotic v. eukaryotic)\nwhether they are unicellular or multicellular.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Yeast and bacteria cells at 400x magnification.\n\n\nThe first comparison to make is between bacteria and yeast (Figure 3.1). Superficially, they appear similar in that they are both microscopic and unicellular. However, there are a couple important differences. Recall from your first semester of General Biology that Bacteria are prokaryotes, which means that they have the smallest cells and lack organelles. Yeasts are single-celled fungi and like other eukaryotes they have generally larger cells that contain organelles, such as a nucleus and mitochondria. Comparing Figure 3.1 and Figure 3.2 shows just how much of a size difference there is between the two at 400x magnification.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Mold and yeast in a petri dish.\n\n\nThe other important comparison to make is between colonies of bacteria and yeast compared to mold (Figure 3.2). As a multicellular fungus, mold is easy to distinguish from the unicellular bacteria or yeast under a microscope. Even without magnification, molds are easily identified by their “fuzzy” appearance, which is due to their body morphology of long, filamentous strands growing over top each other.\nLet’s take a closer look at the type of microbes you will encounter during this lab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGive it a try\n\n\n\nTogether with your partner, get yourself set up with a microscope. Then, for each of the groups of microbes indicated below obtain and examine the indicated specimen to create a set of sketches with labeled key features and annotations of your observations. You will use these as a reference to identify microbes present in your spoiled milk later on, so make sure that you are familiar with the key features.\nYou will submit your drawings as part of your post-lab assignment. You can sketch them on paper and take pictures, or for you high-tech digital notetakers sketch them on a tablet and expor them as a png or jpg. Remember to include a title, magnification etc in your images.\nIf you are using an iPhone very likely your default output is HEIC which is an apple-specific high efficiency file format. They are great if you are keeping pictures on your phone - not so great when you are sharing them, especially cross platform. You can make a small change on your iphone options to create a readily shareable and outside-of-apple-products-usable file format.\n\nOpen the Camera section in the Settings app\nUnder Formats, select “most compatible” instead of “high efficiency”\n\nNow, when you take a new photo or video it will be saved as JPEG instead of HEIF/HEIC.\n\n\nFungal Mold\n\nWithout magnification, visually examine the mold colony of Penicillium camemberti.1\nUnder low magnification using a dissection microscope sketch a portion of the mold colony and label fungal hyphae (thin filamentous body).\nAnnotate your sketch in the right hand margin or neatly below your labels to describe key characteristics and observations.\n\n1 Species Note: We won’t see P. camemberti in our spoiled milk experiment, but the species is a good example of fungal mold that grows on dairy. This species creates the flavorful “rind” on soft-ripened cheeses such as Camembert and Brie.Bacteria shapes: bacilli (rods), cocci (spheres), and spirilla (spirals)\n\nMake sure you have had a demo on proper use and clean-up of oil immersion before getting started.\nWith a compound microscope, examine prepared slide #380 of bacterial shapes using the oil immersion technique for highest magnification.\nSketch examples of the three different bacterial forms, labelling each.\nAnnotate your sketch in the right hand margin or neatly below your labels to describe key characteristics and observations (e.g. size of cells relative to each other, other observations).\n\nYeast cells\n\nUsing a compound microscope, examine prepared slide #378 of yeast Candida albicans2.\nSketch several yeast cells.\nLabel and annotate your sketch in the right hand margin or neatly below your labels to describe key characteristics and observations (e.g. list features that distinguish yeast cells from bacterial cells for easy reference on how to distinguish them).\n\n2 Species Note: We also won’t see C. albicans in our spoiled milk experiment, but the species is a good example of a common yeast. The species lives naturally in small amounts in all human bodies. When the yeast overgrows it causes infections, such as thrush (oral bumps) or vaginal yeast infections.\n\n3.1.4 Succession in Milk\nBiologists have discovered that, as pasteurized milk ages, changing conditions in the milk bring about a predictable, orderly succession of microbial communities. As anyone who has opened a bottle of spoiled milk will know, there are a couple distinctive physical attributes of spoiled milk - a strong sour odor is produced and the liquid coagulates into semisolid chunks (a process called curdling) - all in all, a very unpleasant experience. These physical changes are caused by various microbes in the milk. These microbes have been well-studied and the following facts will be useful as you write your hypothesis statement during lab class as to the expected changes in the microbe community as milk ages.\n\nRefrigerated, unspoiled milk has a pH of ~6.5\nStreptococcus (round-shaped cocci) and Lactobacillus (rod-shaped bacilli) bacteria naturally occur in milk and survive pasteurization\nStreptococcus and Lactobacillus both ferment lactose sugar into lactic acid and acetic acid\nStreptococcus bacteria thrive in milk with pH &gt; 5.5\nLactobacillus bacteria grow in milk with pH &gt; 4.5\nTwo common bacteria that always manage to get into milk from the environment, Pseudomonas and Achromobacter (both rod-shaped bacilli), digest butterfat and produce a putrid smell\nAn acidic environment causes casein to solidify, or curd\nYeasts and molds grow well in acidic environments"

Data are the raw inputs, while results are the processed outputs that help draw conclusions. In other words, the difference lies in the level of processing and interpretation:\n\nData refers to raw, unprocessed observations, measurements, or facts collected during an experiment or study. Data can be qualitative (e.g., descriptions, images) or quantitative (e.g., numbers, measurements).\nResults are the analyzed and interpreted form of data.

Negative space is really important when comparing prints.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGive it a try\n\n\n\nCompare these prints of different animals and see if you can find C, and different styled X shapes in the negative space.\n\n\n\n\n\nComparison of print shapes\n\n\nAnimal tracks are not just defined by individual prints, but also by their positioning and pattern—this tells us about the animal’s gait (the way it moves).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGive it a try\n\n\n\nDefine the terms stride/leap and straddle. Then make a small sketch indicating how to measure these components of a track.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nStride (or Leap): The distance between two successive prints made by the same foot. This tells us how far an animal moves with each step or jump.\nHow to Measure:\n\nFind two consecutive prints made by the same foot (e.g., right front foot to the next right front foot).\nMeasure the distance from the heel of the first print to the heel of the second print.\nFor bounding, hopping, or leaping gaits, this is sometimes called a leap instead of a stride.\n\nStraddle: The width between the left and right tracks of an animal’s trail. Straddle indicates how much an animal’s legs spread apart while walking.\nHow to Measure:\n\nFind a straight section of a trackway.\nMeasure the perpendicular distance between the outer edges of the left and right prints.\nNarrow straddle: Tracks are close together (e.g., fox, deer)/Wide straddle: Tracks are spaced far apart (e.g., raccoon, bear).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.1.2 Know Your Gaits\nLet’s make sure you are familiar with the typical traits we expect to see. Below are the common gaits you are likely to see1:1 ProTip: Learn the “language” of tracks… when you are asked to annotate your sketches these are the types of descriptors you should use.\n\n7.1.2.1 Walking Gaits\nExample Animals: Deer, foxes, bobcats, raccoons\nCharacteristics:\n\nPrints appear in a straight line or slightly staggered.\nEach foot moves independently in a 4-step pattern.\nPerfect Walkers (e.g., foxes, bobcats) place their hind foot directly in the print of the front foot (this conserves energy in deep snow).\nImperfect Walkers (e.g., raccoons, bears) have a slight offset between front and back feet.\n\nHow to Identify: Look for a steady, rhythmic pattern with evenly spaced prints.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGive it a try\n\n\n\nMake a sketch of tracks from a perfect and imperfect walker.\n\n\n\n\n7.1.2.2 Bounding Gaits\nExample Animals: Weasels, fishers, mink\nCharacteristics:\n\nThe animal leaps forward with both front feet landing together, followed by the back feet landing near or in the same spot.\nTracks appear in sets of two or four closely spaced prints.\nTypical of animals with long, flexible bodies that use bounding to move quickly.\n\nHow to Identify: Look for side-by-side front paw prints followed by hind paws landing close together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGive it a try\n\n\n\nMake a sketch of tracks from a bounder.\n\n\n\n\n7.1.2.3 Hopping and Leaping Gaits\nExample Animals: Rabbits, squirrels\nCharacteristics:\n\nHind feet land ahead of the front feet, creating a “Y” or staggered pattern.\nThe larger hind feet provide power for the jump, while the smaller front feet land first.\nOften seen in prey animals escaping predators.\n\nHow to Identify: Look for two small front prints followed by two large hind prints positioned ahead of them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGive it a try\n\n\n\nMake a sketch of tracks from a leaper/hopper."

    "text": "7.2 Methods\nOn our hike, keep an eye out for prints - then follow it. A single print won’t tell you much, but a pattern of multiple tracks can reveal how an animal moves and why. Use the track finder key to identify them. Remember, track size and gait together help determine the species. Consider snow depth as for example, deep snow may alter the expected gait.\nRemember, in the field we are on a buddy system - keep an eye out for each other and make sure everyone is safe. Don’t wander off on your own and please don’t return to campus or leave lab before having checked in (well out) with a lab instructor so we know we haven’t left anyone out in the snow.\nSketch the prints & tracks you saw on the trail. Your sketches should be accurate and detailed to help with species identification as well as record the context in which you found the sketch. This includes labeling key features and annotating important observations.\n\n7.2.1 Step 1: Make a Clear Sketch\n\nLocate a set of tracks. If possible, choose a track with a full set of front and hind prints to compare.\nFind a well-defined individual print within a trackway. If you cannot find one “perfect” print, you can create a “composite sketch” based on several individual prints to make sure you are including all the key characteristics\nDraw draw the outline of the print carefully. Pay attention to the shape of the toes, presence of claws, and the central pad.\n\n\n\n7.2.2 Step 2: Measure and Record Data & Label Key Features\nRecord your measurements next to your sketch to compare with field guides and label key features of your print:\n\nTotal Length – Distance from the tip of the longest toe/claw to the back of the heel pad.\nTotal Width – Widest part of the print.\nIf present: Metacarpal (central pad of the foot), Claw Marks – If visible, measure from the front of the toe pad to the tip of the claw.\nIf possible measure the gait and straddle.\n\n\n\n7.2.3 Step 3: Annotate Your Observations\nAnnotations are short notes that describe key aspects of the track. Use the following prompts to guide your observations; of course include anything else that you notice that seems important to you. Margins and space below are a great place for annotations. You can also use an arrow to indicate a specific feature of the print itself.\nPrint Details\n\nDo the toes point forward, or do they splay outward?\nAre claw marks visible? (Can help distinguish between canine and feline tracks.)\nIs the print symmetrical or asymmetrical?\n\nTrack Measurements & Gait\n\nWhat is the stride length (distance between two successive prints of the same foot)?\nWhat is the straddle width (distance between the left and right tracks)? This not onl helps identify species—narrow straddles suggest energy-efficient movement, while wider straddles may indicate waddling or side-to-side motion.\nAre the prints evenly spaced (perfect/imperfect walking) or clustered (bounding/hopping)?\nDo distances between prints change? If so what does that tell you? Stride (or leap) length gives clues about speed—longer strides mean the animal was moving quickly.\nAre the tracks in a straight line?\nAre there tracks from multiple individuals? Are they the same species?\n\nEnvironmental Context\n\nWhat kind of habitat is the track found in (open field, under trees, near water)?\nDoes the track appear fresh or partially melted?\nAre there any other signs nearby, like scat, fur, or feeding marks?\n\nThe track finder booklet has helpful notes on pages 1, 4-5, 12-13, 22-23, 32, and 46."

    "section": "6.1 What is winter ecology?",
    "text": "6.1 What is winter ecology?\nWinter ecology focuses on how organisms adapt to and interact with cold, snow-covered environments. Scientists study how animals, plants and ecosystems respond to snow and cold, the energy cost of staying alive and active in winter, how food, shelter, and movement strategies change and how climate change is impacting winter environments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider this\n\n\n\nBriefly discuss what challenges animals face in winter compared to other seasons and possible adaptations to overcome these.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nIn winter, animals face challenges such as colder temperatures, reduced/limited food availability, and harsher environmental conditions like snow and ice - for example, deep snow that makes movement harder. Some animals migrate to avoid these challenges, while others hibernate or develop special adaptations like thicker fur or fat stores to survive. Predators may have difficulty finding prey, while herbivores must search for food buried under snow. Some animals, such as snowshoe hares, have physical adaptations like white fur for camouflage and large feet for better movement in snow. Behavioral adaptations, such as altering activity patterns or caching food, also help them survive through the colder months.\n\n\n\nWinter ecologist investigate a wide range of questions.\n\nHow do animals move and survive in snow? - What strategies do animals use to travel across snow (e.g., walking, bounding, hopping)? - How does snow depth and type affect movement?\nHow do animals find food in winter?\n\nWhat do herbivores eat when plants are covered in snow?\nHow do predators hunt in snow-covered landscapes?\n\nHow do animals stay warm in cold temperatures?\n\nWhat morphological adaptations help animals conserve heat?\nWhat behavioral adaptations help animals conserve heat?\n\nHow do winter conditions shape ecosystems?\n\nHow do temperature, snowfall, and ice impact food webs and species interactions?\nHow does snow act as an insulating layer for plants and small animals?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider this\n\n\n\nExpand on your short discussion from the question above by writing a short response to each of these question (sets) based on our prior knowledge and/or intuition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do animals move and survive in snow? Animals move in different ways depending on snow conditions. Deer have long legs to walk through deep snow, while snowshoe hares have large feet that help them stay on top of the snow. Some animals, like weasels, use tunnels under the snow to stay hidden and move more easily.\nHow do animals find food in winter? Many herbivores eat twigs, bark, and dried leaves when fresh vegetation is unavailable. Squirrels store nuts in the fall to eat during winter, and some birds change their diet to include seeds and insects hidden under tree bark. Predators like foxes use their keen hearing to detect small animals moving under the snow.\nHow do animals stay warm in cold temperatures? Animals stay warm through a combination of fur, fat, and behavior. Some grow thick winter coats or store extra fat for insulation. Others huddle together for warmth or seek shelter in burrows. Birds fluff up their feathers to trap heat, and some animals, like bears, hibernate to conserve energy.\nHow do winter conditions shape ecosystems? Snow acts as an insulator, protecting small mammals and plants from extreme cold. It also affects predator-prey interactions—wolves have an advantage over deer in deep snow because of their larger paws. Streams may freeze, changing the availability of water for animals. As climate change alters winter conditions, species may struggle to adapt."

    "section": "6.2 Why observe animal tracks?",
    "text": "6.2 Why observe animal tracks?\nWinter provides a unique opportunity to study wildlife through the tracks animals leave behind in the snow. These tracks offer valuable insights into the presence, movement, and behavior of animals that might otherwise remain unseen. By analyzing track patterns, we can determine which species are active in a given area, their gaits and movement speeds, and even interactions such as predation or foraging. Tracking also helps us understand habitat use, as different species prefer distinct environments based on food availability, cover, and terrain. Additionally, snow preserves tracks more clearly than other substrates, making winter an ideal time to study the ecology of organisms and their responses to seasonal changes in temperature, food scarcity, and predation risk. Observing animal tracks is a non-invasive way to monitor biodiversity and gain a deeper understanding of how species interact with their environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider this\n\n\n\nBriefly reflect on the importance of developing observational skills and sketching in field studies, especially since we could much more easily take photos (3-5 sentences).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nCareful observation is a fundamental skill in field biology, and sketching is one of the best ways to develop and refine it. While taking pictures can be useful, sketching requires focused attention to detail—forcing the observer to slow down, notice subtle characteristics, and think critically about what they are seeing. This process enhances memory retention, improves spatial awareness, and helps build pattern recognition skills. Additionally, sketching allows for the inclusion of important contextual information, such as measurements, substrate type, and weather conditions, which photographs may not capture effectively."
