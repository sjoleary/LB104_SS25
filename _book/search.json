    "text": "Course Logistics\nWelcome to our lab handbook for General Biology II (Spring 2025) - it will be continuously updated throughout the semester. For the most part an electronic copy of this lab manual will be sufficient1, if you need to print anything for a class you will be prompted to do so on Canvas as part of your pre-lab assignments.1 You can go “split screen” on your laptop which will allow you to cut and paste code if needed or if you have a tablet you can pull up the manual there which gives you a better simultaneous viewing experience.\nThe lab portion of this course will consist of one one-off lab, followed up by three research projects:\n\nUnit 1: Climate & Biomes\nUnit 2: Community Ecology: Marvelous World of Milk Microbes\nUnit 3: Road Ecology: Salt, Seeds, and Germination Success (?)\nUnit 4: Urban Ecology: Linking Lichen and Urban Landscapes\n\nFor each lab unit we will compile a research compendium that will hold your data and results. We will start off with more scaffolded activities and assignments and as you become more confident in your skills you will be increasingly independent in designing your experiments.\nOver the course of the semester you will become increasingly independent in your ability engage in all aspects of the scientific process, starting with making observations on the foundation of which you will formulate a hypothesis, design an experiment to test this hypothesis and make predictions about the outcome, collect, visualize, and analyze data, and report your findings in a written format.\nAfter completing the lab component of this course, you will have a fundamental skill set that will allow you to\n\nmake observations and use these to formulate a question and generate a hypothesis.\ndesign an appropriate experiment to generate and collect data to answer your question.\ncollect, visualize, and analyze data using appropriate qualitative and quantitative methods.\ncommunicate your research findings following the convention of a written scientific report including (1) an introduction that describes the context for the general research question and specific hypothesis being tested, (2) a description of the methods used to collect and analyze data, (3) description of the results including summary figures and tables, and (4) a discussion which identifies and explains central results in the context of the specific hypothesis and general research question posed.\n\nYou will be working in small groups during lab to work through activties, design your experiment and gather and analyze data. At the end of each research project you will submit an individual written report. Generally, you will be assigned some pre-lab work such as background reading before your lab period so we can maximize our time in lab. Each project is unique in the questions we are exploring and the methods we will use to answer them. You will at times be expected to complete tasks/assignments outside of our scheduled lab periods. Some projects will required more time outside of labs than others and you may be involved in more than one module at a time.\nAll lab prep work and graded assignments should be completed by the assigned deadlines. No late work is accepted. Make sure you are planning ahead so you have enough time to ask for help if you need it.\nFor the lab component of this course to run smoothly, you will need to take an active role in preparing for and participating in lab. It is your responsibility to be aware of communications made in the syllabus, through announcements on Canvas, or emails. While it is always our goal to make those in a timely fashion, some last minute calls may be unavoidable. Similarly, you are expected to arrive for your lab period on time and prepared for the planned activities, including completing all assigned tasks and/or reading assignments, bringing your laptop and charger, along with any lab-related handouts2. We will be working with a lot of digital documents this semester, avoid last minute computer-related disasters by saving your work frequently and regularly backing up your files on an external drive or the cloud that you can access from another computer. If you run into issues where you will not have access to a laptop, contact your instructor and Dr. O’Leary as quickly as possible so we can make sure you can participate e.g. by finding you an alternate laptop to complete assignment in/out of lab.2 For documents that are digital including write-ups of your study design, spreadsheets with data etc. make sure that you can easily access those during lab periods. For any hard copies make sure that you print those and bring them with you as instructed.\nAll members of a group are expected to contribute to the design of each project along with collecting and analyzing data. It’s important that you establish a good working relationship with your group and hold each other accountable for the contributions that you make to this project; this may involve scheduling meetings outside of lab time. Strive to be a good team player by making sure you are responsive to your group and have open lines of communication to arrange meetings and complete assignments. We will frequently combine data sets within groups and lab sections or across sections for analysis to get large sample sizes and/or replicates, therefore it is critical that you complete out-of-lab assignments by the posted deadlines in order for your group to be able to progress through the research projects. Procrastination is frequently at the root of assignments not being completed well. When you are collaborating with others be mindful that your time management will impact the time management of others. Account for this both when you plan as a group how to divide up work and in how you complete tasks assigned to you by making sure to get started early enough to not hold up your group. While it is primarily your responsibility to coordinate and work with your group, if you are having difficulties with group members not contributing as agreed upon or other problems working together, please reach out to Dr. O’Leary or your lab instructor and we will step in to help facilitate a solution.\nAttendance in lab is mandatory. You are allowed one absence per semester. You should always inform both your instructor and Dr. O’Leary in writing (an email) of your absence before lab. If you will be missing lab due to a direct conflict with a planned college-sponsored event you must contact your instructor and Dr. O’Leary at least one week in advance as that will give us more flexibility in planning how you can complete the lab and/or assign alternative activities. Regardless of the reason you are missing lab, you are responsible for material covered in lab and completing any pre-lab and/or homework assignments associated with a missed lab period; we will communicate with you in which form you will need to make-up in-lab assignments and activities. Additionally, you should always contact your group members for whatever project(s) you are currently working on as soon as possible to learn what you will be responsible for on any group assignments.\nThis semester will include some field-based activities. Your safety is always a priority and while it is always our goal to design activities that are accessible to everyone and minimize risk there are more factors that we cannot control outside of the lab. Help us out by using common sense, keeping an eye on your lab mates, and advocating for yourself. For field-based activities please make sure that you check the weather conditions ahead of time and then ensure you are appropriately dressed in terms of layers to stay warm or cool, with shoes that can get muddy or wet. If it is sunny/hot out make sure to wear sun screen and/or a head covering, bring water etc. if you have any allergies or other medical conditions that might require emergency treatment, please let your instructor know and carry any medication you might need on you (inhaler, EpiPen, etc). Occasionally there may be unavoidable weather-related last minute changes, please make sure to check your email/Canvas for last minute notifications. If you are doing any field work on your own outside of lab time, please be mindful of your safety, at the very least let somebody know where you are going and when you expect to be back, ideally bring a buddy with you.\nAcademic dishonesty, including but not limited to cheating, plagiarism, or turning in someone else’s work as your own will not be tolerated. Make sure you are properly citing the sources of ideas, figures, data, etc. in your lab reports. Plagiarism not only includes direct, word-for-word quotations without identifying it as a direct quote using quotation marks and citing the source but also paraphrasing other people’s ideas, arguments, or structure without properly acknowledging them. Learning how to properly summarize and paraphrase information from an original source is an important skill, as we generally do not use word-for-word citations in the scientific reports in the natural sciences. While it is acceptable to use large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence applications to assist you in correcting grammar, syntax or spelling or to generate synonyms, you should not use LLMs generate larger sections of text for you3. If you are unsure if you are properly attributing components of your written assignments, please come talk to your lab instructor or Dr. O’Leary4, we are happy to help. Evidence of academic dishonesty will at minimum result in a zero on that assignment along with an automatic notification of the Dean.3 Given the definitions of plagiarism above consider how this can fall into both the narrow category of not attributing a direct citation. Additionally, you don’t know the extent to which the LLM is “borrowing” other peoples ideas, arguments, or structure of presenting them. As a results, you would not be properly attributing content and ideas to those sources.4 As a rule of thumb: If you are using LLMs or AI in a way that you are not comfortable us as instructors knowing about, that is a strong indication that you are doing something you should not be."
