    "section": "",
    "text": "Course Logistics\nWelcome to our lab handbook for General Biology II (Spring 2025) - it will be continuously updated throughout the semester. For the most part an electronic copy of this lab manual will be sufficient1, if you need to print anything for a class you will be prompted to do so on Canvas as part of your pre-lab assignments.1 You can go “split screen” on your laptop which will allow you to cut and paste code if needed or if you have a tablet you can pull up the manual there which gives you a better simultaneous viewing experience.\nThe lab portion of this course will consist of one one-off lab, followed up by three research projects:\n\nUnit 1: Climate & Biomes\nUnit 2: Community Ecology: Marvelous World of Milk Microbes\nUnit 3: Road Ecology: Salt, Seeds, and Germination Success (?)\nUnit 4: Urban Ecology: Linking Lichen and Urban Landscapes\n\nFor each lab unit we will compile a research compendium that will hold your data and results. We will start off with more scaffolded activities and assignments and as you become more confident in your skills you will be increasingly independent in designing your experiments.\nOver the course of the semester you will become increasingly independent in your ability engage in all aspects of the scientific process, starting with making observations on the foundation of which you will formulate a hypothesis, design an experiment to test this hypothesis and make predictions about the outcome, collect, visualize, and analyze data, and report your findings in a written format.\nAfter completing the lab component of this course, you will have a fundamental skill set that will allow you to\n\nmake observations and use these to formulate a question and generate a hypothesis.\ndesign an appropriate experiment to generate and collect data to answer your question.\ncollect, visualize, and analyze data using appropriate qualitative and quantitative methods.\ncommunicate your research findings following the convention of a written scientific report including (1) an introduction that describes the context for the general research question and specific hypothesis being tested, (2) a description of the methods used to collect and analyze data, (3) description of the results including summary figures and tables, and (4) a discussion which identifies and explains central results in the context of the specific hypothesis and general research question posed.\n\nYou will be working in small groups during lab to work through activties, design your experiment and gather and analyze data. At the end of each research project you will submit an individual written report. Generally, you will be assigned some pre-lab work such as background reading before your lab period so we can maximize our time in lab. Each project is unique in the questions we are exploring and the methods we will use to answer them. You will at times be expected to complete tasks/assignments outside of our scheduled lab periods. Some projects will required more time outside of labs than others and you may be involved in more than one module at a time.\nAll lab prep work and graded assignments should be completed by the assigned deadlines. No late work is accepted. Make sure you are planning ahead so you have enough time to ask for help if you need it.\nFor the lab component of this course to run smoothly, you will need to take an active role in preparing for and participating in lab. It is your responsibility to be aware of communications made in the syllabus, through announcements on Canvas, or emails. While it is always our goal to make those in a timely fashion, some last minute calls may be unavoidable. Similarly, you are expected to arrive for your lab period on time and prepared for the planned activities, including completing all assigned tasks and/or reading assignments, bringing your laptop and charger, along with any lab-related handouts2. We will be working with a lot of digital documents this semester, avoid last minute computer-related disasters by saving your work frequently and regularly backing up your files on an external drive or the cloud that you can access from another computer. If you run into issues where you will not have access to a laptop, contact your instructor and Dr. O’Leary as quickly as possible so we can make sure you can participate e.g. by finding you an alternate laptop to complete assignment in/out of lab.2 For documents that are digital including write-ups of your study design, spreadsheets with data etc. make sure that you can easily access those during lab periods. For any hard copies make sure that you print those and bring them with you as instructed.\nAll members of a group are expected to contribute to the design of each project along with collecting and analyzing data. It’s important that you establish a good working relationship with your group and hold each other accountable for the contributions that you make to this project; this may involve scheduling meetings outside of lab time. Strive to be a good team player by making sure you are responsive to your group and have open lines of communication to arrange meetings and complete assignments. We will frequently combine data sets within groups and lab sections or across sections for analysis to get large sample sizes and/or replicates, therefore it is critical that you complete out-of-lab assignments by the posted deadlines in order for your group to be able to progress through the research projects. Procrastination is frequently at the root of assignments not being completed well. When you are collaborating with others be mindful that your time management will impact the time management of others. Account for this both when you plan as a group how to divide up work and in how you complete tasks assigned to you by making sure to get started early enough to not hold up your group. While it is primarily your responsibility to coordinate and work with your group, if you are having difficulties with group members not contributing as agreed upon or other problems working together, please reach out to Dr. O’Leary or your lab instructor and we will step in to help facilitate a solution.\nAttendance in lab is mandatory. You are allowed one absence per semester. You should always inform both your instructor and Dr. O’Leary in writing (an email) of your absence before lab. If you will be missing lab due to a direct conflict with a planned college-sponsored event you must contact your instructor and Dr. O’Leary at least one week in advance as that will give us more flexibility in planning how you can complete the lab and/or assign alternative activities. Regardless of the reason you are missing lab, you are responsible for material covered in lab and completing any pre-lab and/or homework assignments associated with a missed lab period; we will communicate with you in which form you will need to make-up in-lab assignments and activities. Additionally, you should always contact your group members for whatever project(s) you are currently working on as soon as possible to learn what you will be responsible for on any group assignments.\nThis semester will include some field-based activities. Your safety is always a priority and while it is always our goal to design activities that are accessible to everyone and minimize risk there are more factors that we cannot control outside of the lab. Help us out by using common sense, keeping an eye on your lab mates, and advocating for yourself. For field-based activities please make sure that you check the weather conditions ahead of time and then ensure you are appropriately dressed in terms of layers to stay warm or cool, with shoes that can get muddy or wet. If it is sunny/hot out make sure to wear sun screen and/or a head covering, bring water etc. if you have any allergies or other medical conditions that might require emergency treatment, please let your instructor know and carry any medication you might need on you (inhaler, EpiPen, etc). Occasionally there may be unavoidable weather-related last minute changes, please make sure to check your email/Canvas for last minute notifications. If you are doing any field work on your own outside of lab time, please be mindful of your safety, at the very least let somebody know where you are going and when you expect to be back, ideally bring a buddy with you.\nAcademic dishonesty, including but not limited to cheating, plagiarism, or turning in someone else’s work as your own will not be tolerated. Make sure you are properly citing the sources of ideas, figures, data, etc. in your lab reports. Plagiarism not only includes direct, word-for-word quotations without identifying it as a direct quote using quotation marks and citing the source but also paraphrasing other people’s ideas, arguments, or structure without properly acknowledging them. Learning how to properly summarize and paraphrase information from an original source is an important skill, as we generally do not use word-for-word citations in the scientific reports in the natural sciences. While it is acceptable to use large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence applications to assist you in correcting grammar, syntax or spelling or to generate synonyms, you should not use LLMs generate larger sections of text for you3. If you are unsure if you are properly attributing components of your written assignments, please come talk to your lab instructor or Dr. O’Leary4, we are happy to help. Evidence of academic dishonesty will at minimum result in a zero on that assignment along with an automatic notification of the Dean.3 Given the definitions of plagiarism above consider how this can fall into both the narrow category of not attributing a direct citation. Additionally, you don’t know the extent to which the LLM is “borrowing” other peoples ideas, arguments, or structure of presenting them. As a results, you would not be properly attributing content and ideas to those sources.4 As a rule of thumb: If you are using LLMs or AI in a way that you are not comfortable us as instructors knowing about, that is a strong indication that you are doing something you should not be."

    "text": "1.3 A climate zone is a section of earth’s surface defined by its mean annual temperature and total annual precipitation along with monthly/seasonal variations and extremes\nWeather is a snapshot of atmospheric conditions at a specific time point and location and can be broken down into readily measurable, discrete characteristics including temperature, precipitation, wind speed/direction, cloud coverage, and air pressure. By contrast, climate a statistical “portrait” on a long-term time scale1. To describe the climate of a specific location, scientists determine long-term averages and identify the extremes for a specific place, region, or an entire planet based on a single or multiple measuring stations.1 Typically, averages are calculated over at least 30 years to describe climate.\nIn 1884, the German-Russian botanist and climatologist2 Wladimir Köppen published a climate classification scheme that is still widely used today with some modifications from the original definitions. These climate zones are defined by their mean annual temperature and total annual precipitation along with monthly/seasonal variations and extremes and roughly form latitudinal bands. For larger continents the oceans and mountain ranges will impact patterns temperature and precipitation and result in regional differences.2 Even though we have distinct definitions for climate zones vs biomes you will notice in today’s lab that these concepts are tightly linked, with climate being the primary determinant of biomes - though Köppen identifed climate zones based on his experience as a botanist and used characteristic types of vegetation to help identify climate zones.\n\nGroup A: tropical climates are characterized by high levels of precipitation and every month having an average temperature of &gt;18°C.\nGroup B: arid climates are primarily defined by very low levels of precipitation and include hot deserts (subtropics, average annual temperature &gt;18°C) and cold deserts (coldest month average temperature &gt;0°C).\nGroup C: temperate climates are primarily defined by moderate temperatures with the coldest month having average temperatures between 0°C - 18°C and at least one month with an average temperature &gt;10°C and can include both regions with one dry/wet season or no significant difference between seasons in terms of precipitation. Overall, they have a wider variation of temperature and precipitation compared to tropical and arid climates.\nGroup D: continental climates are colder compared to temperate climates and have a wider range of temperatures with at least one month with average temperatures &lt;0°C and at least one month &gt;10°C though precipitation patterns are similar to temperature climates, where depending on the regions there may be a pattern of wet/dry season or no dry season.\nGroup E: Includes polar and alpine climates3 that feature the coldest temperatures with an average temperature &lt;10°C and low levels of precipitation.\n\n3 If you increasing in altitude and latitude you will a similar experience of decreasing temperature though for different regions.A climatogram or climograph is a graphical summary of monthly long-term averages of temperature and precipitation and are a useful tool to describe the climate of a given location.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Climatograph for Manchester, NH. This graph is labeled both for the metric system (degrees Celsius and millimeters) and the English system (degrees Fahrenheit and inches), as budding scientists, we will be using the metric system for lab but you’ll be able to refer back to this figure as a point of orientation to units you are more familiar with.\n\n\nClimatograms have double x-axis that allows them to depict to data sets in one graph. For example, Figure 1.2 summarizes the average monthly patterns for temperature on the left x-axis using a line graph (red line) and the precipitation as a bar chart on the right x-axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGive it a try\n\n\n\nUse the climograph for Manchester to answer the following questions about Manchester’s climate.\n\nMaximum average monthly temperature: ……. (hottest month: …….)\nMinimum average monthly temperature: ……. (coldest month: …….)\nAverage annual temperature: …….\nMaximum monthly precipitation: ……. (wettest month: …….)\nMinimum monthly precipitation: …….

    "text": "1.4 Global climate patterns are largely determined by input of solar energy\nThe curved shape of Earth’s surface results in latitudinal variation in the amount of solar energy received at earth’s surface, warming the atmosphere, land, and oceans.\n\nThe Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn are the northern and southern circles of latitude4 at which the sun can be directly overhead5.\nThe Arctic and Antarctic Circle6 are the northern and southern most latitudes at which during the June and December solstice the sun dues not rise/does not set all. Currently, these are located at approx. 66.33°N/S.\n\n4 Due to the wobble in earth’s axis the exact location changes over time, currently it is at about 23.4°5 This occurs at the June (Northern) and December (Southern) solstice at which point the planet reaches its maximum tilt towards the sun.6 Collectively, these are referred to as the polar circlesAdditionally, the tilt of earth’s axis relative to its axis means that throughout a year the different locations on earth’s surface differ in whether they are tilted towards or away from the planet and thus the incoming angle of solar energy, resulting in seasonal variation of the climate. At the equator, this effect is negligible but the increases towards the poles.\nThe differences in the amount of energy received at earth’s surface result in a temperature gradient with highest temperatures at the equator that decrease moving north and south towards the pols. In turn, these temperature differences drive global patterns of atmospheric circulation and precipitation.\n\nHigh levels of evaporation at the equator result in warm, wet air masses rising and flowing towards the pols, creating a low pressure zone (Intertropical convergence zone, ITCZ). As the air rises, it cools, releasing most of the water vapor and resulting in high levels of precipitation in the tropics.\nAround 30°N/S, the dry air has cooled and now sinks towards earth’s surface, creating a high pressure zone with some of the air flowing back to the equator and some of it towards the poles along the surface. In both cases, the dry air absorbs most of the moisture thus creating the arid climates found in the subtropics, forming a band of deserts north and south of the tropics.\nAt the poles, cold air descends, creating a high pressure zone, with air flowing towards the mid-latitudes at the earth’s surface. Around 60°N/S, this air meets air flowing away from the equator. This creates another low pressure zone with air masses rising, cooling and releasing precipitation and resulting in dry air flowing towards the poles/equator.\n\nIn short, there are three cells of overturning air circulation that create alternating patterns of low pressure zones associated with high levels of precipitation and high pressure associated with low levels of precipitation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGive it a try\n\n\n\nComplete the sketch summarizing major patterns of air circulation and precipitation to include lines representing incoming solar energy. Indicate differences in the angle at which the energy is received and highlight areas that receive the most/least amount of energy creating a latitudinal gradient in temperature."

For example, even if there might be distinct combinations of plants and animals found in tropical forests in Africa, compared to those in South America or Southeast Asia, they are still are characterized by tall dominant trees and an overall very high diversity of plants animals.\nYou would also notice that all of these tropical forests share a similar climate characterized by high temperatures with little variation throughout the year, a very high total annual amount of precipitation with a high variation - typically tropical forests have only two seasons, one of which is extremely rainy.

    "text": "After completing this unit, you should be able to\n\nOutline the scientific method as an iterative process of observation, hypothesis formation, experimentation, data collection & analysis, and conclusion drawing.\nUse spreadsheets to enter and manage data.\nDescribe the key components of experimental design to ensure conclusions are reliable.\nGenerate and interpret descriptive statistics summarizing distribution, central tendency and variability of a data set.\nExecute and interpret a statistical to determine the probability that results are result of sampling error and do not represent reality.\n\nOver the course of the semester you will be introduced to fundamental principles of scientific method and experimental design and start to built a basic tool kit of data analysis skills. Additionally, you will develop your scientific writing skills as you compile a report on each of the three projects we will work on. We will complete various activities in parallel to your first research projects as you develop these skills."
