# Winter Ecology: Animal tracks {#sec-scientific-method--experimental-design}

**After completing this unit, you should be able to**

-   Snowshoe safely & have doing it.
-   Identify animal tracks using a key.
-   Observe, sketch, and annotate animal tracks.
-   Describe wildlife prints & tracks in terms of straddle, stride/leap.
-   Distinguish characteristic types of gaits (perfect/imperfect walking, bounding, hopping & leaping).

The purpose of today's lab is to explore winter ecology in a very hands on (snowshoe on?) way. We will identify wildlife and interpret their activity by observing their tracks & trails. Okay, fine - we want to have a no pressure, fun lab activity this week!
