# Marvelous World of Milk Microbes {#sec-ecological-succession}

After completing this unit, you should be able to

-   describe the general process of ecological succession and formulate a testable hypothesis about changes in the microbial community of spoiled milk.
-   distinguish between quantitative and qualitative data.
-   apply microscopy techniques to distinguish between bacterial shapes, yeasts and molds.
-   use a pH meter to determine pH
-   inoculate culture pretri dishes and make smear slides by heat fixing and staining bacteria.
-   collect, analyze and interpret qualitative data on microbe community composition.

In this unit we will explore the ecological succession in different milks.
