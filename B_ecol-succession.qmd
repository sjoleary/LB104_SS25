# Marvelous World of Milk Microbes {#sec-marvelous-world-of-milk-microbes}

After completing this unit, you should be able to

-   describe the general process of ecological succession and formulate a testable hypothesis about changes in the microbial community of spoiled milk.
-   apply microscopy techniques to distinguish between bacterial shapes, yeasts and molds.
-   use a pH meter to determine pH of a liquid.
-   record observations of environmental changes in milk.
-   inoculate culture pretri dishes and make smear slides by heat fixing and staining bacteria.
-   distinguish between quantitative and qualitative data.
-   collect, analyze and interpret qualitative data on microbe community composition.

In this unit we will explore the ecological succession in the microbe communities growing in unrefridgerated, aged milk and compare differences and similarities across different milk types.
