# Biomes {#sec-biomes}

After completing this unit, you should be able to

-   Define what climate zones and biomes are.

-   Explain how latitudinal variation of solar input shapes global patterns of temperature, air circulation, and precipitation.

-   Describe the primary factors and underlying mechanisms determining the distribution of climate zones.

-   Recognize distinguishing characteristics of major biomes.

-   Organize biomes by increasing/decreasing temperature and amounts of total annual precipitation.

In this unit we will explore the mechanisms creating climate zones and how inverstigate how they shape terrestrial biomes.
